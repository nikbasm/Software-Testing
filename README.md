# Software-Testing

In the context of Software Testing course we have created a heart monitor to apply Unit Testing as well as Blackbox Testing techniques.

A Heart Monitor - This program simulates the controller of a heart monitoring device. The system continuously monitors the heart functions of a hospital patient. It reads the pulse, the oxygen level as well as blood pressure. Its main purpose is to raise alarms if there is something seriously wrong, and the patient might die.
